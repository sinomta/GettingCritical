<h2>Our cake Design &</h2>
<h3>Prices</h3>
<p>Our birthday cakes vary in cost ranging from ±R375 for a basic 8” cake with a piped birthday message, to R2000, R4000, or even more, for an elaborately decorated, tiered or shaped cake,All of our cakes are designed and quoted for individually according to your needs. Please note that any cakes will be quoted for according to the size and amount of detail in the design. The prices vary. For example, a 2-tier cake will range from R700+ and more basic kiddies shaped cakes start at R375+depending on sizes. These prices are indicators, and can give you an idea of the approximate cost of a cake.As all orders are quoted for individually according to your specific requests, we may not be able to give an immediate quotation on a specialized cake design,Our cake pricing depends on two things: The number of people the cake needs to serve and the size of the slices required, as well as your budget for the cake, which is often the most important aspect of determining your design. Your budget for the cake will affect how large a cake we can offer, as well as the amount of work we can put into the decorations on the cake. Our prices are calculated depending on the amount of work that goes into making the cake and decorations.  Our larger custom-designed cakes,  are all baked and iced individually.
